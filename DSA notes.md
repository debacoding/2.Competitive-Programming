# Array
* Array is a data structure used to store homogeneous elements at contiguous locations.
* Accessing Time: O(1) {This is possible because elements
                      are stored at contiguous locations}   
* Search Time:   O(n) for Sequential Search
               O(log n) for Binary Search {If Array is sorted}
* Insertion Time: O(n) {The worst case occurs when insertion 
                     happens at the Beginning of an array and 
                     requires shifting all of the elements}
* Deletion Time: O(n) {The worst case occurs when deletion 
                     happens at the Beginning of an array and 
                     requires shifting all of the elements}
